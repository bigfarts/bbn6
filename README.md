netplay for mega man battle network 6 in the style of https://github.com/ssbmars/BBN3-netcode. the b in bbn6 does NOT stand for "better".

## how to use

1.  start the bundled vba-rr in `vba-rr/VBA-rr-svn480+LRC4.exe`

1.  go to _File > Open GBA Rom..._ and load the game (either MEGAMAN6_FXX or MEGAMAN6_GXX)

1.  if you are:

    -   **server:**

        1. go to _Tools > Lua Scripting > New Lua Script Window..._ and load `main_server.lua`.

    -   **client:**

        1. edit `vba-rr/lua/main_client.lua` to set `HOST` to the opponent's IP.

        2. wait for the opponent to run `main_server.lua`. they MUST start the server first.

        3. go to _Tools > Lua Scripting > New Lua Script Window..._ and load `main_client.lua`.

1.  in game, go to _Comm > LINK CBL > NetBattl > SnglBatt > Practice_. once both players have connected, you should both be in battle. glhf!
